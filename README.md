Web Scraping for Fun and Profit
===============================

Code samples used during my lightning talk at [code4lib BC](http://wiki.code4lib.org/BC), November 2014.

To clone this repo, run the following command:

```
git clone git@github.com:mjordan/scrapingforfunandprofit.git
```

To use the Python scripts, you need to have the [Beautiful Soup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) and [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/) libraries installed. Using the PHP script does not require installation of any third-party libraries.
