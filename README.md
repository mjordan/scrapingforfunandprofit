Web Scraping for Fun and Profit
===============================

Code samples used during my lightning talk at [code4lib BC](http://wiki.code4lib.org/BC), November 2014. The [slidedeck](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1015702/linked_to/Web%20Scraping%20for%20Fun%20and%20Profit.pdf) from the talk is also available.

To clone this repo, run the following command:

```
git clone git@github.com:mjordan/scrapingforfunandprofit.git
```

To use the Python scripts, you need to have the [Beautiful Soup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) and [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/) libraries installed. Using the PHP script does not require installation of any third-party libraries.
